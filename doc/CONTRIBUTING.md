Contributing to the HikoLang project
===================================

Issues
------

Bugs and other issues can be reported on the [Issue](https://github.com/hikogui/hikolang/issues)
page on github.

The easiest way to contribute is by reporting issues with HikoGUI.
When reporting an issue with HikoGUI, make sure to clearly state:

 - The machine setup: "Linux with RenderDoc installed."
 - The steps to reproduce: "I build HikoLang in x64-linux-dbg"
 - The outcome you expected: "I expected the build to succeed"
 - The actual outcome: "Got error ... at log.hpp:15"

Pull Requests
-------------

We are happy to accept pull requests for fixes, features and new widgets.
In order to avoid wasting your time, we highly encourage opening an
[Discussion](https://github.com/hikogui/hikolang/discussions) or an
[Issue](https://github.com/hikogui/hikolang/issues) to discuss
whether the PR you're thinking about making will be acceptable.

If you like to work on an already existing [Issue](https://github.com/hikogui/hikolang/issues),
you may want to assign yourself to that issue before working on it,
to reduce the chance of two people working on the same pull request.

It could be helpful having a more real time discussion through discord at:
[Society of TJ](https://discord.gg/CSddDuM) channel #HikoGUI/general.

We have written down a [code style](docs/code_style.md) which may help you
understand certain constructs in our code. Currently we are transitioning
to this new code style, so you may find some code that does not conform
to this, don't worry about this :smile:

Installation and Build Instructions
