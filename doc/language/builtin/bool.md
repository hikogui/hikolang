# bool

## Declaration

```
var bool = enum (false = 0, true = 1)
```

## Description
The `bool` type is a built-in type that represents a boolean value. It can be either `true` or `false`. The `bool` type is used in conditional statements and logical operations. It is a built-in type since other built-in functionality depends on it.

`true` and `false` are not keywords, but are instead implemented as standard enum values.
